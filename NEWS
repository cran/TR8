## synonyms

   Now tr8() accepts a new argument, 'synonyms': when it is set to
   true the function will use 'tnrs' function from the package
   'taxize' to search for synonyms of the provided species list and
   search trait data for them as well. 



## Catminat database

	Thanks to the `readxl` package, now the dataset (which is in
    `xlsx` format) can be read without external dependencies
    (i.e. users do not have to worry about installing `perl`)

## BROT, PLANTS and Ecological Flora of California traitbases


     Three new databases are added as sources of data: BROT (mainly related to mediterranean
     species), PLANTS and Ecological Flora of California (from USA).
